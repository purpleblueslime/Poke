# Poke

**Poke**, **snap** and send quick pics to poke your friends anytime, anywhere! 👻🍥

## Why Poke? 🎬

We all love to share our lives, but sometimes you just want to say something fast — a quick hello, a funny face, or a snap of what’s happening 'round you. **Poke** is made for those moments when words aren’t enough, but you don’t want to spend time crafting long posts. It’s fast, simple, and designed to get you closer to your friends with the snap of a finger.
