# Poke

**Poke**, **snap** and send quick pics to poke your friends anytime, anywhere! 👻🍥

## Why Poke? 🎬

We all love to share our lives, but sometimes you just want to say something fast — a quick hello, a funny face or a snap of what’s happening 'round you. **Poke** is made for those moments when words aren’t enough but you don’t want to spend time crafting long posts. It’s fast, simple and designed to get you closer to your friends with the snap of a finger.
